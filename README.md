# 📘 Data Structures Fundamentals with C# 

Welcome to the **Data Structures Fundamentals** course repository! Here, I'll be sharing my solutions and notes from SoftUni's **Data Structures Fundamentals** course, covering essential data structures and practical exercises that reinforce theoretical concepts. 🎓

## 🌟 Course Overview

This **Data Structures Fundamentals** course provides a comprehensive introduction to the most commonly used **data structures** in programming. Through practical exercises and foundational theory, you'll explore the implementation of lists, queues, stacks, trees, and algorithms like **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. You’ll learn to use not only built-in libraries but also implement custom data structures, enabling a deeper understanding of when and how to apply each structure in real-world scenarios. 📊

## 🛠️ Skills Acquired

By following along with this repository, you’ll gain skills in:

- 📈 **Algorithm Complexity Analysis** - Evaluate and understand the efficiency of different algorithms.
- 🌲 **Tree Data Structure Representation** - Represent and manipulate hierarchical data structures.
- 🔍 **Data Structure Traversal** - Learn and implement DFS and BFS for efficient data traversal.
- 🌳 **Binary and Balanced Trees** - Apply binary trees and balanced trees in problem-solving.
- 🎛️ **Priority Queues** - Use and implement priority queues to manage prioritized data.
- 📜 **Linear Data Structure Implementation** - Create and manipulate lists, stacks, and queues.
